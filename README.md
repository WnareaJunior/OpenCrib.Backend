# OpenCrib.Backend 🏠🔗

**Backend API for the OpenCrib platform**

OpenCrib is a platform that lets anyone **host anything and find their people**—from house shows and art pop-ups to workshops and meetups. This repository contains the **C# .NET MVC REST API** backend that talks to **MongoDB**.

> ⚠️ **Status:** The previously deployed Azure API is **currently offline**. The endpoint URLs below reflect the intended routes but are not live at the moment.

## ⚙️ Configuration

  * `ConnectionStrings:Mongo` – full MongoDB URI
  * `MongoDb:ConnectionString` and `MongoDb:DatabaseName`
* ASP.NET:

  * `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` = `Development` | `Production`

**Example `appsettings.Development.json`**

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Mongo": "mongodb://localhost:27017"
  },
  "MongoDb": {
    "DatabaseName": "opencrib_dev"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

## 🔒 Security (Roadmap)

* JWT-based authentication & role-based authorization (Host vs. Attendee)
* Input validation & schema constraints
* Rate limiting and request size limits
* CORS rules for web/iOS clients
* Indexes on common query fields (e.g., `username`, `zipCode`, `geo`)

---
